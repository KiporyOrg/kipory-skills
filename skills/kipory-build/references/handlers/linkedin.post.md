# `linkedin.post` — Fetch a LinkedIn post

Look up one LinkedIn post or article and its numbers.

Reads one public LinkedIn post or article from its link: headline, text, author, time and its like and comment counts. A link to another site is refused before anything is fetched.

- **Group:** sources · **Phase:** `ingest` · **Effect class:** `read`
- **Re-run:** a retry inside the run `converges` · a new run of the same input `converges`
- **I/O:** `string` → `SocialPost`
- **Reads:** One LinkedIn post or article link. Results are cached for a day. _(shape hint: `string`)_
- **Emits:** A `SocialPost`. A bare `{}` when the post does not exist or is not public.
- **Softens these failures:** `vendor-refused`, `rate-limited`, `not-found`, `error` — the step still finishes with a warning, and a `failureSlot` on it then holds the code (`step-fields.md` §6).
- **Suggested input streams:** `source`
- **External dependency:** ScrapeCreators — Reads LinkedIn through ScrapeCreators. Uses a ScrapeCreators API key: the project's own, stored in its secrets, or Kipory's.
- **Credential:** resolved from the secrets vault as type `api_key`, purpose `scrapecreators` (vendor: ScrapeCreators); falls through to the platform's own key when no node holds one.
- **Charged as:** `scrapecreators/credit` per item — one of the vendor's own credits, as each response reports them — an answer served from the vendor's cache takes none; a request takes 1, and a step makes one request. Each is a row of `GET /v1/nodes/{nodeId}/vendor-prices`, which gives its price in credits and any included units or floor; a step spending a stored vendor key is not charged it.
- **Rate limit:** 120 per min in bucket `scrapecreators` — shared with `facebook.ad`, `facebook.ads`, `facebook.page`, `facebook.posts`, `google.ad`, `google.ads`, `instagram.comments`, `instagram.post`, `instagram.posts`, `instagram.profile`, `instagram.search`, `instagram.search-profiles`, `instagram.transcript`, `linkedin.ad`, `linkedin.ads`, `linkedin.company`, `linkedin.posts`, `linkedin.profile`, `reddit.comments`, `reddit.post`, `reddit.posts`, `reddit.search`, `threads.post`, `threads.posts`, `threads.profile`, `threads.search`, `tiktok.ad`, `tiktok.ads`, `tiktok.audience`, `tiktok.comments`, `tiktok.followers`, `tiktok.following`, `tiktok.post`, `tiktok.posts`, `tiktok.profile`, `tiktok.search`, `tiktok.transcript`, `x.posts`, `x.profile`, `x.transcript`, `youtube.comments`, `youtube.posts`, `youtube.search`, `youtube.transcript`
- **Queue:** 3 attempts, exponential from 2 s; waits up to 5 min; cache 1 day — the handler's default; a step replaces it with `reuseResultsForMinutes` (`0` always fetches fresh)

## Config

_No operator-tunable config._

## Worked example

Looks up one LinkedIn post from its link.

#### A post link

The post's text, author and engagement.

Reads `string` → emits `SocialPost` · 1 in → 1 out

Input:

```
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/satyanadella_ai-activity-7200000000000000000-abcd
```

Output:

```
{
  "platform": "linkedin", "id": "7200000000000000000",
  "text": "We are announcing …",
  "author": { "name": "Satya Nadella" },
  "counts": { "likes": 5200, "comments": 310 }
}
```
