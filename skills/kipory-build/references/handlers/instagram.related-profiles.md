# `instagram.related-profiles` — Fetch related Instagram accounts

List the accounts Instagram suggests beside one account.

Reads the accounts Instagram suggests on one public account's page, from its handle or profile link. Each has its handle, name, link, picture, and verified and private flags; no bio, no counts. Many accounts show none. A link to another site is refused.

- **Group:** sources · **Phase:** `ingest` · **Effect class:** `read`
- **Re-run:** a retry inside the run `converges` · a new run of the same input `converges`
- **I/O:** `string` → `SocialProfile[]`
- **Reads:** One Instagram handle, with or without `@`, or a profile link. Results are cached for a day. _(shape hint: `string`)_
- **Emits:** A list of `SocialProfile`. Empty when the account shows no suggestions or does not exist.
- **Softens these failures:** `vendor-refused`, `rate-limited`, `not-found`, `error` — the step still finishes with a warning, and a `failureSlot` on it then holds the code (`step-fields.md` §6).
- **Suggested input streams:** `source`
- **External dependency:** ScrapeCreators — Reads Instagram through ScrapeCreators. Uses a ScrapeCreators API key: the project's own, stored in its secrets, or Kipory's.
- **Credential:** resolved from the secrets vault as type `api_key`, purpose `scrapecreators` (vendor: ScrapeCreators); falls through to the platform's own key when no node holds one.
- **Charged as:** `scrapecreators/credit` per item — one of the vendor's own credits, as each response reports them — an answer served from the vendor's cache takes none; a request takes 1, and a step makes one request. Each is a row of `GET /v1/nodes/{nodeId}/vendor-prices`, which gives its price in credits and any included units or floor; a step spending a stored vendor key is not charged it.
- **Rate limit:** 120 per min in bucket `scrapecreators` — shared with `facebook.ad`, `facebook.ads`, `facebook.page`, `facebook.posts`, `google.ad`, `google.ads`, `instagram.comments`, `instagram.post`, `instagram.posts`, `instagram.profile`, `instagram.search`, `instagram.search-profiles`, `instagram.transcript`, `linkedin.ad`, `linkedin.ads`, `linkedin.company`, `linkedin.post`, `linkedin.posts`, `linkedin.profile`, `reddit.comments`, `reddit.post`, `reddit.posts`, `reddit.search`, `threads.post`, `threads.posts`, `threads.profile`, `threads.search`, `tiktok.ad`, `tiktok.ads`, `tiktok.audience`, `tiktok.comments`, `tiktok.followers`, `tiktok.following`, `tiktok.post`, `tiktok.posts`, `tiktok.profile`, `tiktok.search`, `tiktok.transcript`, `x.posts`, `x.profile`, `x.transcript`, `youtube.comments`, `youtube.posts`, `youtube.search`, `youtube.transcript`
- **Queue:** 3 attempts, exponential from 2 s; waits up to 5 min; cache 1 day — the handler's default; a step replaces it with `reuseResultsForMinutes` (`0` always fetches fresh)

## Config

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxItems` | integer, more than 0, at most 100 | no | `20` | The most accounts to return, up to 100. This read is one request whatever the bound. |

## Worked example

Lists the accounts Instagram suggests beside one account.

#### A handle

One entry per suggested account.

Reads `string` → emits `SocialProfile[]` · 1 in → 1 out

Input:

```
nasa
```

Output:

```
[
  { "platform": "instagram", "id": "66873381803",
    "handle": "itsallykrinsky", "name": "ally krinsky",
    "url": "https://www.instagram.com/itsallykrinsky/", "verified": false }
]
```
