# `instagram.search-profiles` — Search Instagram accounts

Find Instagram accounts by a name or a phrase.

Runs Instagram's own account search for a name or phrase and returns the accounts in its order, each with handle, name, link and picture. The first ten also carry bio, category, private and verified flags, and follower, following and post counts.

- **Group:** sources · **Phase:** `ingest` · **Effect class:** `read`
- **Re-run:** a retry inside the run `converges` · a new run of the same input `converges`
- **I/O:** `string` → `SocialProfile[]`
- **Reads:** One name or phrase. Results are cached for a day. _(shape hint: `string`)_
- **Emits:** A list of `SocialProfile`. Empty when nothing matches.
- **Softens these failures:** `vendor-refused`, `rate-limited`, `not-found`, `error` — the action still finishes with a warning, and a `failureSlot` on it then holds the code (`action-fields.md` §6).
- **Suggested input streams:** `source`
- **External dependency:** ScrapeCreators — Reads Instagram through ScrapeCreators. Uses a ScrapeCreators API key: the project's own, stored in its secrets, or Kipory's.
- **Credential:** resolved from the secrets vault as type `api_key`, purpose `scrapecreators` (vendor: ScrapeCreators); falls through to the platform's own key when no node holds one.
- **Charged as:** `scrapecreators/credit` per item — one of the vendor's own credits, as each response reports them — an answer served from the vendor's cache takes none; a request takes 1, and an action makes one request. Each is a row of `GET /v1/nodes/{nodeId}/vendor-prices`, which gives its price in credits and any included units or floor; an action spending a stored vendor key is not charged it.
- **Rate limit:** 120 per min in bucket `scrapecreators` — shared with `facebook.ad`, `facebook.ads`, `facebook.page`, `facebook.posts`, `google.ad`, `google.ads`, `instagram.comments`, `instagram.post`, `instagram.posts`, `instagram.profile`, `instagram.search`, `instagram.transcript`, `linkedin.ad`, `linkedin.ads`, `linkedin.company`, `linkedin.post`, `linkedin.posts`, `linkedin.profile`, `reddit.comments`, `reddit.post`, `reddit.posts`, `reddit.search`, `threads.post`, `threads.posts`, `threads.profile`, `threads.search`, `tiktok.ad`, `tiktok.ads`, `tiktok.audience`, `tiktok.comments`, `tiktok.followers`, `tiktok.following`, `tiktok.post`, `tiktok.posts`, `tiktok.profile`, `tiktok.search`, `tiktok.transcript`, `x.posts`, `x.profile`, `x.transcript`, `youtube.comments`, `youtube.posts`, `youtube.search`, `youtube.transcript`
- **Queue:** 3 attempts, exponential from 2 s; waits up to 5 min; cache 1 day — the function's default; an action replaces it with `reuseResultsForMinutes` (`0` always fetches fresh)

## Config

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxItems` | integer, more than 0, at most 100 | no | `20` | The most accounts to return, up to 100. This read is one request whatever the bound. |

## Worked example

Finds Instagram accounts that match a name.

#### A name

One entry per account, in Instagram's order.

Reads `string` → emits `SocialProfile[]` · 1 in → 1 out

Input:

```
hormozi
```

Output:

```
[
  { "platform": "instagram", "id": "7547682342", "handle": "hormozi",
    "name": "Alex Hormozi", "url": "https://www.instagram.com/hormozi/",
    "verified": true }
]
```
